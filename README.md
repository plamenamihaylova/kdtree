### Task specification

ðŸ”—Detailed specifications for the assignment can be
found [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php).

The task is to write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square using a 2d-tree to support efficient
range search and nearest-neighbor search.
By unit square we will understand such a square that all its points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1.
By range search we will understand finding all the points contained in a query rectangle.
By nearest neighbor search we will understand finding the closest point to a query point.

The task is to implement two approaches to this problem: **brute-force** implementation and **2d-tree** implementation.

For the brute-force implementaion can be used `java.util.TreeSet`.

For the 2d-tree implementation mutable data type `KdTree.java` that uses a 2d-tree should be implemented.

A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys.
The idea is to build a BST with points in the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly
alternating sequence.

#### PointSET API

```
public class PointSET {
   public PointSET()                            // construct an empty set of points 
   public boolean isEmpty()                     // is the set empty? 
   public int size()                            // number of points in the set 
   public void insert(Point2D p)                // add the point to the set (if it is not already in the set)
   public boolean contains(Point2D p)           // does the set contain point p? 
   public void draw()                           // draw all points to standard draw 
   public Iterable<Point2D> range(RectHV rect)  // all points that are inside the rectangle (or on the boundary) 
   public Point2D nearest(Point2D p)            // a nearest neighbor in the set to point p; null if the set is empty 
   public static void main(String[] args)       // unit testing of the methods (optional) 
}
```

#### KdTree API

```
public class KdTree {
   public PointSET()                            // construct an empty set of points 
   public boolean isEmpty()                     // is the kd-tree empty
   public int size()                            // number of points in the kd-tree
   public void insert(Point2D p)                // add the point to the kd-tree
   public boolean contains(Point2D p)           // does the tree contain point p? 
   public void draw()                           // draw all points to standard draw 
   public Iterable<Point2D> range(RectHV rect)  // all points that are inside the rectangle (or on the boundary) 
   public Point2D nearest(Point2D p)            // a nearest neighbor in the tree to point p; null if the tree is empty 
   public static void main(String[] args)       // unit testing of the methods (optional) 
}
```
